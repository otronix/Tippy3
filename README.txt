Submitted by: Orion Richardson

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Custom font
* [X] UI animations
* [No, it is designed to be more stylish. Video did not mention this requirement and I spent too much time achieving the style I was looking for to reverse it.] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

 - Alpha and motion animations.

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
